Hime is a Go Web Framework.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/moonrhythm/hime/wiki) for guide more information.

## Why Framework

I ‚ù§Ô∏è net/http but... there are many duplicated code when working on multiple projects,
plus no standard. Framework creates a standard for developers.

### Why Another Framework

There is many Go frameworks out there. But I want a framework that works with any net/http compatible libraries seamlessly.

For example, you can choose any router, any middlewares, or handlers that work with standard library.

That why hime won't ship with any handler include router üôà
